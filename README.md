# FAQ

**Where do the Godot Project File and scenes fall in the Licencing structure?**

They don't. Non-code, non-art files are under copyright. Our final intent is for a total release of these assets under CC - either once the project makes back it's cost plusenough money to fund or partially fund the next game, or six years after release.

Aknowledge the impossibility of preventing cracks, We ask that piracy groups who put together a warez version of the game please ask their audience to buy a copy if they enjoy it/
